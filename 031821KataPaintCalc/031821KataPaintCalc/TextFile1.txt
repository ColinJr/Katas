Write a program that calculates the amount of paint needed to paint a ceiling 
given input of the rooms length and width. Round up, as you would need a whole 
new bucket to cover even a partial bucket of paint. Each paint can covers 400 ft.


	1# Define length and width variables as empty ints, bucketArea = 400
	2 #Prompt user input on command line, map input to variables
	3 ceilingLength * ceilingWidth = CeilingArea
	4 ceilingArea/bucketArea rounded up = paint cans needed
	5 Print result
	1.5? Define room length, width, and height, numOfObstructions and obstructionArea
	2.5? ask room length, width, height, and how many obstructions
	2.6? make an array based on how many obstructions there are
	2.7? ask for each obstruction's length and height
	2.8? for each obstruction, calculate obstruction length * height, add that to obstruction area




Ultra extreme Bonus: Make it calculate the amount needed for walls, and ceiling given the 
whole room's measurements, and the measurements of any doors and windows in 
the room. remove area of doors and windows to find paint needed for whole room.

Check input is correct measurements?
